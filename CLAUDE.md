# Working Agreement

- Never commit, push, or create PRs. Only edit/create files. The user handles all git operations.
- Work directly in the project root (`./ai-thon/`). Do not use git worktrees.
- Keep README.md Steps section updated: add each completed step as a new numbered `[x]` entry.
- Refer to [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for game design and architecture.
- Refer to [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) for the build plan. Check off tasks (`[x]`) as they are completed.
