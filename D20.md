# What is the D20 System?

The D20 System is the core rules engine behind Dungeons & Dragons (5th edition). It was released by Wizards of the Coast as the **System Reference Document (SRD 5.1)** under the **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY-4.0)**, making it freely available for anyone to use and build upon.

The entire system revolves around one mechanic: **when the outcome is uncertain, roll a 20-sided die, add a modifier, and compare against a target number.** Every skill check, attack roll, and saving throw in the game reduces to this single resolution formula: `d20 + modifier >= target number`. The richness comes from what modifiers apply (ability scores, proficiency, class features) and what the target number represents (Difficulty Class, Armor Class, spell save DC).

This game implements a focused subset of the D20 SRD as fully on-chain smart contracts on Starknet.
